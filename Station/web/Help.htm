          SmartGarden is a distributed, multi-station and Internet-connected irrigation and environment monitoring solution.

          <br />
          SmartGarden consists of the Master controller that is connected to the Internet, and (optionally) multiple Remote stations. Master controller uses RF (900 MHz) for communication with Remote stations.<br />
          <br />
          SmartGarden can control multiple irrigation zones, connected directly to the Master controller and to Remote stations, as well as multiple environmental sensors (templerature, humidity, soil moisture, water flow meters etc) connected to Master or Remote stations.<br />
          <br />

          <p><b>SmartGarden UI</b></p>
          SmartGarden Home screen shows quick status of the system, current sensors readings, currently running or next scheduled irrigation zone, as well as water use over the last week. 
          Also Home screen provides navigation menu for accessing all functionality.<br />

          SmartGarden is written by <a href="http://tony-osp.dreamwidth.org">Tony-osp</a>, inspired by <a href="https://opensprinkler.com/">OpenSprinkler</a> ideas and based on <a href="https://github.com/rszimm/sprinklers_pi/">Sprinklers_pi</a> project ideas. SmartGarden uses some of the modules (nntp, tftp and some others) from Sprinklers_pi project, as well as design ideas and patterns. However functionally SmartGarden is considerably different and much more powerful than both OpenSprinkler and Sprinklers_pi systems.
